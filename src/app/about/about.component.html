        The sweetest and most triumphant moment for any NBA team is when a championship is won.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the league’s 65-year history, 65 teams have had the honor of calling themselves the ultimate basketball
        winners
        of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s the ’65 Boston Celtics, ’87 Los Angeles Lakers or ’97 Chicago Bulls, there is no doubt that every
        championship-winning team embodied greatness.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, how do the championship teams in the league’s history compare to one another? The thought is quite
        intriguing.
      </p>
      <p>That’s why I compiled a list of the greatest teams in NBA history.</p>
      <p>The list was difficult to create, and it’s more relative than absolute.</p>
      <p>
        It was based largely on each team’s dominance in its particular year, rather than on the "which team would win"
        question.
